## Outline

> “Visualizations give you answers to questions you didn’t know you had”
> — Ben Shneiderman

Data visualization is a fundamental skill for quantitative social
scientists, both for exploratory data analysis and communicating results
effectively. This session gives an introduction to data visualization
principles and application using the R package `ggplot2`.

`ggplot2` is an incredibly popular package for data visualization, used
by academics, data journalists (such as BBC, New York Times and the
Guardian) and citizen scientists around the world. `ggplot2` allows
users to combine simple elements to create sophisticated and
illuminating visualizations to better understand and tell stories with
data.

The course will cover the basic facilities of `ggplot2` with
hands-on-practical sessions. We will also demonstrate some of the more
advanced capabilities of `ggplot2`, by introducing its mapping
capabilities. By the end of this course participants will be able to
create publication-ready graphics using `ggplot2`’s core functionality,
will be able to use `ggplot2` as a tool for effective exploratory data
analysis, and will have a foundation on which to learn `ggplot2`’s more
advanced functions.

Participants should have basic familiarity with the `R` statistical
programming language.
