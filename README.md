# Introduction to data visualization with `ggplot2`

> “Visualizations give you answers to questions you didn’t know you had” - Ben Shneiderman

Data visualization is a fundamental skill for quantitative social scientists, both for exploratory data analysis and communicating results effectively. This session gives an introduction to data visualization principles and application using the R package `ggplot2`.

`ggplot2` is an incredibly popular package for data visualization, used by academics, data journalists (such as BBC, New York Times and the Guardian) and citizen scientists around the world. `ggplot2` allows users to combine simple elements to create sophisticated and illuminating visualizations to better understand and tell stories with data.

The course will cover the basic facilities of `ggplot2` with hands-on-practical sessions. We will also demonstrate some of the more advanced capabilities of `ggplot2`, by introducing its mapping capabilities. By the end of this course participants will be able to create publication-ready graphics using `ggplot2`'s core functionality, will be able to use `ggplot2` as a tool for effective exploratory data analysis, and will have a foundation on which to learn `ggplot2`'s more advanced functions.

Participants should have basic familiarity with the `R` statistical programming language.
