- Position along a common scales
- Position along identical, nonaligned scales
- Length
- Angle – Slope
- Area
- Volume

#  Vanderplas

- The whole [paper](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-statistics-031219-041252) is interesting!

- 3.1. Cognitive Principles
- 3.1.1. Proximity - "objects or shapes that are close to one another appear to form groups... place items to compare close together, and less important comparisons further apart"
- 3.1.2. Similarity - "we group things that have similar appearances and exclude objects with different appearances"; "coloring points or bars according to a categorical variable or by using points of different shapes to represent different categories."
- 3.1.3. Common region. "elements contained within a common region belong together"
- 3.1.4. Common fate.
     - Strong negative association is not easily detected from overlaid line plots, but it is easily seen in a scatter plot (Tomasetti 2015).

# Match perceptual and data topography (Wickham 2012)
- If you’re using a graphical element to show relative size of quantities, make larger size = larger quantity!
- For example, which represents larger value?

#  Vanderplas
##  3.2. Chart Design


- Dual coding: You can encode the same variables to multiple aesthetic parameters (easily in `ggplot2`) to aid comprehension
- This can also aid accessibility by reducing reliance on e.g. colour to distinguish variables
- Use colour scales designed to have good perceptual properties for different kinds of colour-blindness (`ggplot2` defaults aren't so good for this)

# Cleveland's principles of graph construction

1. Clear vision
    - Make the data stand out and avoid superfluity
    - Use a reference line if there is an important value which must be seen across the whole graph
2. Clear understanding
    - Put major conclusions in graphical form
    - Clearly explain error bars
3. Scales
    - Choose axes ranges to include or nearly include the range of data
    - Don’t insist that zero is included in scales showing magnitude
4. General strategy
    - Graphing should be iterative and experimental
    - Graph data two or more times if it is needed
