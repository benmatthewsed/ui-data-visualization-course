## Why `ggplot2`

- _Perception_: using `ggplot2` will help you understand how data visualization works, how to figure out what you want your plots to look like and describe this to the computer.
- _Powerful and popular_. You can make pretty much any type of graph you want. Large community working on extending `ggplot` for specific use cases. Use in production by BBC, NY Times, FT, 538...
- Make _publication_ (or Twitter) quality graphs. Used by range of people to communicate with different audiences - help *you* to communicate with different audiences.
