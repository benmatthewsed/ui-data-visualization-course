# What is `ggplot2`?

- It's an `R` package that draws graphs, developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)

- From the [tidyverse website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): "`ggplot2` is a system for __declaratively__ creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell `ggplot2` how to map variables to aesthetics, what [visual marks to use to represent data points], and it takes care of the details." 

- ... and what's the Grammar of Graphics? Our `ggplot2` [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) says this is "the idea that you can __build every graph from the same components__: a data set, a coordinate system, and `geom`sâ€”visual marks that represent data points."

# Great, so why plot with `ggplot2`?

## Perception

- Learning `ggplot2` will help you __understand how data visualization works__, how to figure out what you want your plots to look like and describe this to the computer.
- This is because it's __declarative__. You describe to the computer exactly what you want the plot to look like and it draws it for you (rather than, say, picking a type of plot from a menu)
- So by using `ggplot2` you learn how to make __better__ graphs, not just how to make graphs

# 2. It's powerful  `r emo::ji("muscle")`
---

## It's Powerful
- Because it's declarative it's also __flexible__
- You can make pretty pretty much __any type__ of (static) graph you want! (No fancy interactive web graphics though, sorry)
- This is very powerful! You can make _publication_ (or Twitter) quality graphs

# 3. It's popular `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`

## It's popular

- There is a large community of users who use `ggplot2` to communicate with very different audiences
- `ggplot2` is used by data journalists at major outlets [BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/) and [Financial Times](https://johnburnmurdoch.github.io/slides/r-ggplot/#/)
- As well as technical users who have [extended](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) `ggplot2`'s core functions for specific use cases
- You can use the same tool to visualize data effectively for academic audiences as well as the general public (also just for ourselves), and because users often post their code online you learn from these many users!

# One more thing before we begin...

## `ggplot2` is beautiful and fallible

- `ggplot2` is a world unto itself (technically, it's a [domain specific language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/dsl.html)): even for existing `R` users you will probably make mistakes as you get to grips with it
- It's also a world with [idiosyncrasies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYwXMnC03I4)
- .. so when learning how to use `ggplot2`, mistakes are gonna happen and that's __fine!__ `r emo::ji("thumbsup")`
- Every error is a learning opportunity - we're all building up better mental models of how `ggplot2` works, and finding things that don't work as expected (or at all!) help us do this too `r emo::ji("tada")`
