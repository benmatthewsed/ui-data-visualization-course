# Common problems with `ggplot2`

1. Two joined lines (multiple groups) ["sawtooth"](https://ggplot2-book.org/collective-geoms.html)

    - From _R for Data Science_:
    
    `r knitr::include_graphics("https://ggplot2-book.org/collective-geoms_files/figure-html/oxboys-line-bad-1.png")`

2. Groups == only one observation (categorical x-variable)

    - Data types matter

3. Stat count y aesthetic

    - The geom wants to compute a summary but you've already provided summarised data

4. `+` on newline

    - For [technical reasons I don't understand](https://community.rstudio.com/t/why-put-and-at-the-end-of-lines/1831) this isn't valid R code. So you can't do it!

5. Call inside/outside `aes()`
    - See our discussion on concepts in the grammar of graphics 
    
6. Geom density with small n
    - Plot the raw data and the summary together

7. Variable types
    - Colouring by a factor variable or a continuous one
