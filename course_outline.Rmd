## Outline

> “Visualizations give you answers to questions you didn’t know you had” --- Ben Shneiderman

Data visualization is a fundamental skill for quantitative social scientists, both for exploratory data analysis and communicating results effectively. This session gives an introduction to data visualization principles and application using the R package `ggplot2`.

`ggplot2` is an incredibly popular package for data visualization, used by academics, data journalists (such as BBC, New York Times and the Guardian) and citizen scientists around the world. `ggplot2` allows users to combine simple elements to create sophisticated and illuminating visualizations to better understand and tell stories with data.

The course will cover the basic facilities of `ggplot2` with hands-on-practical sessions. We will also demonstrate some of the more advanced capabilities of `ggplot2`, by introducing its mapping capabilities. By the end of this course participants will be able to create publication-ready graphics using `ggplot2`'s core functionality, will be able to use `ggplot2` as a tool for effective exploratory data analysis, and will have a foundation on which to learn `ggplot2`'s more advanced functions.

Participants should have basic familiarity with the `R` statistical programming language.


## Learning outcomes

1.	Basic principles of data visualization
2.	Basic usage of `ggplot2` (scatterplots, bar plots, fitted lines)
3.	Basic principles of mapping
4.	Basic used of `ggplot2` for mapping





## Program

### Session One

#### Part one (60 mins)
1. Welcome/course plan/house rules/ set-up (10 mins)
2. Why ggplot2? (10 mins)
3. R basics - what's in my dataframe? (10 mins)
4. Basics: ggplot(), geom_<x>, aes() (30 mins)

#### Break (5 mins)

#### Part two (55 mins)
5. Concepts of the grammar of graphics (15 mins)
6. Facets (20 mins)
7. Smooths, transforms, density (20 mins)

#### Break (5 mins)

#### Part three (55 mins)
8. Good dataviz practice (15 mins)
9. gg-gotchas (20 mins)
    i. types of geom, types of data:
         a. only one observation per group: categorical x-var, set group aes
         b. colour scales and continuous, factor variables
    ii. pains in the aes()
         a. settings inside/outside aes() - example of colour
         b. setting aes() in ggplot call rather than geom call
    iii. mapping data to variables: multiple joined lines together
    iv. (maybe) error when + starts new line
    v. problems with transformations
         a. stat count with y aesthetic
         b. geom_density with small numbers
